3. **Risk**: What's the risk of making the change?
4. **Alternatives**: Are there other approaches?
5. **Trade-offs**: What are we gaining vs. losing?
6. **Timeline**: Is this blocking or can it be addressed later?

## Example Feedback Templates

**For Critical Issues:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: SQL Injection Vulnerability

The user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query on line 45:
`query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "'"`

This allows SQL injection attacks. Use parameterized queries instead:
`query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"`, `params: [userName]`

References:
- OWASP SQL Injection: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection
```

**For Suggestions:**
```
🟢 SUGGESTION: Consider Using a More Efficient Data Structure

Currently using an array with indexOf for lookups (O(n)). Consider using a Set for O(1) lookups:

Instead of:
`if (items.indexOf(item) !== -1) { ... }`

Consider:
`const itemSet = new Set(items);`
`if (itemSet.has(item)) { ... }`

This would improve performance with larger datasets, though the current implementation is fine for small arrays.
```

**For Positive Feedback:**
```
✅ EXCELLENT: Error Handling

Great job implementing comprehensive error handling with proper context and user-friendly messages. The try-catch blocks properly clean up resources and the error logging includes all necessary debugging information.
```

Remember: The goal of code review is not just to catch bugs, but to maintain code quality, share knowledge, ensure consistency, and ultimately ship better software. Be thorough, be kind, and be constructive.
